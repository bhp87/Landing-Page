Web Design Project
Introduction
Welcome to this web design project! In this assignment, you'll be creating a web page based on a provided design, consisting of two images: one showcasing the complete website and another detailing fonts and colors used.

Project Guidelines
Skills Required: You should have acquired the necessary skills through previous lessons to complete this project. Feel free to use Google or refer back to lessons for additional guidance.

Pixel Perfection Not Required: Focus on getting the elements in the right position relative to each other. Don't stress about achieving pixel-perfect accuracy; real-life developers often use reference material and don't have everything memorized.

Details and Minor Elements: The design may include details or minor elements you haven't encountered in our lessons. This is intentional. Use external resources, such as Google, for specific details like CSS rounded corners.

README Short Text
This repository contains my implementation of a web page based on a provided design. The project showcases my ability to create a complete web page from scratch, aligning elements with the given design. While I aimed for accuracy, pixel perfection was not the primary focus. Feel free to explore the code and offer feedback. Happy coding!
